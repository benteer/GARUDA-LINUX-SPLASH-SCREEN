## Installation

### For KDE Desktop
1. Copy the `splash` folder into `/home/garuda/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/(your applied theme folder)/contents/`.
2. Paste it there.

If you don't have any folder, then go to your root directory and follow the same process, but you have to open `usr` folder, `local` folder, `share` folder, and so on.
